# Easy-Script-Launcher
Multi-OS (Windows/Linux/Mac OS) utility to manage a list of scripts (python/bash) with various parameters

By allowing to store several scripts within a workbook configuration, with several parameters, this utility makes it easy for a non-developer or someone not totally familiar with the script to
to use a set of scripts by focusing on the parameters.
